# Evirir's osu! skin

`ctb` is the main branch. combo colors are black for ctb, which makes osu! standard hard to play.

For osu! standard, use the `ctb` branch and uncomment out the combo colors (and comment out the black combo colors).

There are small circles in the `assets` folder for playing EZ in ctb.
